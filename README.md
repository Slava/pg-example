# Postgres Packages

Elephants don't fly, most of the time.

This is a heavily work in progress experimental exploration of what it would look like to use Postgres (and by extension, other SQL-like databases) asdfasdfasdfwith Meteor. Expect a lot of stuff to be broken for now until we announce that it's ready for usage.

To see the patterns we are working on, check out the guide here: http://meteor-postgres.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Tell use what you think on the [forum thread](https://forums.meteor.com/t/an-early-look-at-sql-in-meteor/8736)!
